Build Scalable Progressive Web Apps/First Experiences Today. We're Helping You Build Better For The Modern Web.

### About [pwafire.org](https://pwafire.org)

Our mission is to make your **webdev** environment fully stacked up for best web development practices with Progressive Web Apps. 

### Setting up the PWA Development Environment 

We have a **PWA Developer Tips** [repo available here](https://github.com/mayeedwin/pwadev-tips) to help guide you if you're just starting up or want to have your setup checklist done right âœ…

### [What's NEW?]()
We just announced [PWA Fire Bundle 4.0.5](https://github.com/mayeedwin/pwafire/).

 1. ES6 Arrow Functions implementaion.

 2. Using [Intersection Observer](https://github.com/mayeedwin/pwafire/tree/master/bundle/loading), you can now load target images only when the user scrolls down, causing them to display in the viewport.

### Get Started with PWA Fire Bundle
[PWA Fire Bundle](https://twitter.com/pwafire) is an open source [Progressive Web App](https://maye.pwafire.org/articles/building-progressive-web-apps-with-pwafiredev-resources/) Tooling [Bundle](https://github.com/mayeedwin/pwafire/tree/master/bundle/) that provides you with resources to build [Progressive Web Apps](https://maye.pwafire.org/articles/building-progressive-web-apps-with-pwafiredev-resources/) with good web practices. 

It is the most simplest way you can ever convert your web app or website into a 100% [Progressive Web App](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-progressive-web-app-get-started-now-canaan-maye-edwin/) and still have some fun with the code. It doesn't make you a lazy code beast.

### What to do first // Required
Create two empty files in your project's root folder ; `service-worker.js` and `app.webmanifest`. N/B: Make sure to make the configuration changes as documented below.

### Configuration // setup
Get started with configuring the code in this [setup guide here](https://github.com/mayeedwin/pwafire/tree/master/docs)
